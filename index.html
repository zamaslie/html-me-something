            <img src="file:///Users/zamaslie/lc101/html-me-something/firstdayhome.JPG" alt="My First Day Home!">
            <p>I'll remember it for the rest of my life! I was sitting inside of my kennel at the <a href="https://humanebroward.com/">Broward County Humane Society</a>
            when a volunteer came and picked me up and brought me to a room. There was a couple inside who started making weird noises the second they saw me. I guess they were 
            excited to see me, because I went home with them! And boy was I lucky! My new mom and dad were so nice and they had so many toys and delicious treats for me the minute I got home. </p>

                <p>My first walk around my new neighborhood was pretty exciting. I'm a pretty big deal around that area because I'm so cute, so you can imagine how many heads I turned this day.</p>

                <p>I have two sets of grandparents. I haven't met my dad's parents yet but I've met my mom's parents and I love them soooo much. My grandpa said he didn't want any dogs in his house but when he saw me he changed his mind right away. </p>

                <p>Most pups are scared of the vet, but not me! Everytime I go they give me treats and everybody pets me. There's nothing I love more than treats and pets. My parents were really excited this day because apparently I gained weight. I'm officially 16.3 pounds!! </p>
